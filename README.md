# sorcent-rs
Native-rust collection of Source Engine tools. Supports most VTF files with VMT support
currently being worked on, though other file formats such as mdl or vpk are not out-of-scope.

Huge thanks go to Neil Jedrzejewski & Ryan Gregg for creating the [VTFLib](http://nemesis.thewavelength.net/index.php?p=40) 
library and providing source code. This crate wouldn't exist without their work.
